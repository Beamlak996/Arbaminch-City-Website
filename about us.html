                <h1>History of Arbaminch</h1>
                <p>Arba Minch was founded in the early 1960s by the Fitawrari Aemeroselasie Abebe in the area locally known as "Ganta
                Garo". The city succeeded Chencha as the provincial capital city of Gamo Gofa.The oral tradition has it that
                Fitawrari Aemiro Selassie Abebe had to fight with prominent figures of Chencha (Aba Gaga) to move the capital from
                Chencha to Arba Minch (Ganta Garo). One of the reasons for Aemiroselassie Abebe to move the provincial center from
                Chencha to Arba Minch (Ganta Garo) was for travelers from Gidole to Chencha to take a break after a long, hot crossing
                of the arid Rift Valley area. Roads were built linking the new town to Soddo and making Arba Minch only a day's journey
                by road to the capital, Addis Ababa.A telephone line connecting the town to the capital, costing E$ 250,000, was
                turned up on 15 July 1967.
                
                Arba Minch had previously served as a capital city for Gamo Gofa Province (Gamo Gofa Teklay Gizat), North Omo Zone
                (Semen Omo), Kilil 9 (Region 9), Gamo Gofa Zone, and now is serving as a capital city of Gamo Zone.
                
                The Norwegian Lutheran Mission opened a station at Arba Minch in 1970, which included a trade school; the school's
                operation was later taken over by the Mekane Yesus Church. At the beginning of the Ethiopian Revolution public
                demonstrations occurred in the town, and four people were killed in clashes with the police on 28 March 1974.
                Following the revolution privately held plantations were made into state farms.
                
                The 193 million birr Arba Minch Textile Mill was opened on 6 May 1992 in the presence of Ethiopian Prime Minister
                Tamirat Layne. The mill would produce polyester mixed with cotton grey fabrics.According to the SNNPR's Bureau of
                Finance and Economic Development, as of 2003 other amenities in Arba Minch include postal service, 24-hour electrical
                service, a bank and a hospital.May 2010, the Ethiopian Roads Authority awarded a contract worth 563 million E$ to
                the construction firm of Brehane Hagos to build a road 60 kilometers in length from this town to Belta.The United
                States military operated a facility at Arba Minch from 2011 until September 2015. The facility served as the base for
                several General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
